# Project title
**Harmonica** - imitation of piano keyboard

# Description
The main goal of the project was to implement a program that would **simulate the organs**. <br />
The action of the program was to press the keys on the keyboard and extracting the underlying sounds. <br />
In my work I have included the entire octave of sound.<br />
The keyboard was plugged into a PS / 2 serial port for the Spartan 3E Starter.<br />
In addition, I was able to display the currently playing sound on the computer screen. <br />
The connection went through the VGA connector. The project implementation was done using VHDL. <br />
The environment in which the project was created was Xilinx ISE.<br />

# Hardware inventory
In the project I used the following modules and devices:
* Spartan-3E board (XC35500E)
* Tonsil 2-pin speaker
* External keyboard connected to PS / 2 port
* An external monitor connected to the VGA port

# Technologies
* VHDL
